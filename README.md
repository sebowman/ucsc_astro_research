# ucsc_astro_research

This repository contains samples of the work I did for my senior thesis with Dr. Ryan Foley's astrophysics research group at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Included is a Python script I wrote for analysis and manipulation of large astrophysical data files, designed for use on a UNIX system, two Jupyter notebooks in which I performed formatting of data for use with analysis programs written by others, and a third Jupyter notebook in which I created data visualizations.
